/**
Given a signed 32-bit integer x, return x with its digits reversed. If 
reversing x causes the value to go outside the signed 32-bit integer range [-2³¹, 2³¹ - 1
], then return 0. 

 Assume the environment does not allow you to store 64-bit integers (signed or 
unsigned). 

 
 Example 1: 

 
Input: x = 123
Output: 321
 

 Example 2: 

 
Input: x = -123
Output: -321
 

 Example 3: 

 
Input: x = 120
Output: 21
 

 
 Constraints: 

 
 -2³¹ <= x <= 2³¹ - 1
